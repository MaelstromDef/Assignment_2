CSE310 Assignment 2

This Assignment is meant to develop understanding of heap, hash table, and BTS data structures.
In order to achieve this goal, the program must take in information from a cvs file that gathered data from the US Census
Bureau and use it to perform some functions.

Currently, the included files are:

    Controller.cc
    heap.cc
    utility.cc
    query.cc

    heap.h
    utility.h
    query.h
    defns.h

TO-DO:

    Finish find_max query and implement the find_ratio query.
    find_max: created heap SOC array.
        Need to ensure that getSOC will work properly,
        and finish implementation of removing and displaying the max using the altered DELETE_MAX function from heap.h
    find_ratio: not started.

FINISHED FROM TO-DO:

    Finished displaying/removing max.
