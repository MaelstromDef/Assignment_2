CSE310 Assignment 2

This Assignment is meant to develop understanding of heap, hash table, and BTS data structures.
In order to achieve this goal, the program must take in information from a cvs file that gathered data from the US Census
Bureau and use it to perform some functions.

Currently, the included files are:

    heap.cc
    defns.h

TO-DO:

    Finish find_max query and implement the find_ratio query.
    find_max: created heap SOC array. Need to ensure that getSOC will work properly, and then finish implementation of
    removing and displaying the max using the altered DELETE_MAX function from heap.h
