CSE310 Assignment 2

This Assignment is meant to develop understanding of heap, hash table, and BTS data structures.
In order to achieve this goal, the program must take in information from a cvs file that gathered data from the US Census
Bureau and use it to perform some functions.

Currently, the included files are:

    Controller.cpp
    heap.cpp
    hash.cpp
    bst.cpp
    utility.cpp
    query.cpp

    heap.h
    hash.h
    bst.h
    utility.h
    query.h
    defns.h

TO-DO:

    Maintain code and bug fix if necessary.

Implementation Progress:

    find_max:   finished
    find_ratio: finished
    find_occupation: finished
    range_occupation: finished
